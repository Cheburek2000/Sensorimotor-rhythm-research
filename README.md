# Sensorimotor-rhythm-research
Sensorimotor rhythm (mu-rhythm) is a type of electrical activity of the brain that occurs while moving or observing the movements of other people. Studies show that children with impaired speech development often experience a change in sensorimotor rhythm, which may indicate a violation of the functioning of the brain responsible for speech processes.

The study that uses this repository examines the correlations between the mu-rhythm of normotypic children aged 3-4 years and their speech development (speech development is assessed using the PLS-5 methodology).
